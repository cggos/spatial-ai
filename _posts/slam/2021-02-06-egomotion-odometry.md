[TOC]

## Ego-motion

* **Ego-motion** is defined as the 3D motion of a system (ex camera) within an environment.

## Visual Odometry

* **Odometry** is generally used to refer to an elapsed or relative position and orientation and, because it is not absolute, is prone to drift over time.

* **Visual odometry** in general is the estimation of **ego-motion** using computer vision techniques.

## Pose Estimation

* **Pose estimation** means determining position and orientation.
