## CPU Info

8 commands to check cpu information on Linux:  

> * **/proc/cpuinfo**: The /proc/cpuinfo file contains details about individual cpu cores.
> * **lscpu**: simply print the cpu hardware details in a user-friendly format
> * **cpuid**: fetches **CPUID** information about Intel and AMD x86 processors
> * **nproc**: just prints out the number of processing units available, note that the number of processing units might not always be the same as number of cores
> * **dmidecode**: displays some information about the cpu, which includes the socket type, vendor name and various flags
> * **hardinfo**: would produce a large report about many hardware parts, by reading files from the /proc directory
> * **lshw -class processor**: lshw by default shows information about various hardware parts, and the '-class' option can be used to pickup information about a specific hardware part
> * **inxi**: a script that uses other programs to generate a well structured easy to read report about various hardware components on the system

### ARM CPU features

## OpenMP

The [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) API specification for parallel programming, an Application Program Interface (API) that may be used to explicitly direct **multi-threaded, shared memory parallelism**.  

OpenMP有两种常用的并行开发形式: 一是通过简单的 **fork/join** 对串行程序并行化，二是采用 **单程序多数据** 对串行程序并行化。

* [OpenMP in a nutshell](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs3225-GIS/fall16/Lectures/openmp.html)

OpenMP in CMakeLists.txt:  

```cmake
find_package(OpenMP)
if (OPENMP_FOUND)
    set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_C_FLAGS}")
    set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS}")
    set (CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS}")
endif()
```

## OpenACC

[OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/) is a user-driven directive-based performance-portable parallel programming model designed for scientists and engineers interested in porting their codes to a wide-variety of heterogeneous HPC hardware platforms and architectures with significantly less programming effort than required with a low-level model.

## Intel TBB

Intel [Threading Building Blocks (TBB)](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) lets you easily write parallel C++ programs that take full advantage of **multicore performance**, that are portable and composable, and that have future-proof scalability.

## Intel IPP
